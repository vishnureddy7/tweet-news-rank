charlie sheen hits new york - but what is the show?
it's a long way from detroit to new york, especially if you're charlie sheen. one week after his "my violent torpedo of truth/defeat is not an option" tour launched in a disastrous motor city debut, the show rolled into radio city music hall on friday night in a streamlined version that was slightly more sedate -- and quite a bit duller.
