anyone who saw "south park: bigger, longer &amp; uncut" shouldn't be surprised to learn that trey parker and matt stone appear genuinely to love musicals even as they subvert them. what's perhaps less expected is that while "the book of mormon" packs plenty of blissful profanity, sacrilege and politically incorrect mischief, the defining quality of this hugely entertaining show is its sweetness.
