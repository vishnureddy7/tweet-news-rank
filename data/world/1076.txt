protests erupt in syrian kurdish region: activist
protests against baath party rule erupted in kurdish regions of eastern syria on friday, kurdish activists said, a day after president bashar al-assad offered syrian nationality to some kurds. the grant of citizenship on thursday to an unspecified number of kurds is seen as part of a government attempt to cool resentment over nearly five decades of baath party rule and deflect pro-democracy protests.
