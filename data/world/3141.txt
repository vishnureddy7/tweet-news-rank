iran cell planned attacks in kuwait, minister says
kuwait's foreign minister said an iranian spy cell uncovered by the gulf arab state last year monitored the u.s. military presence and possessed explosives to bomb "strategic" facilities. "we are talking about a cell whose task was not only to monitor and record the (u.s.) military presence that is in their view hostile -- the american forces presence on kuwait lands -- but it exceeded that," sheikh mohammad al-salem al-sabah told dubai-based al arabiya television.
