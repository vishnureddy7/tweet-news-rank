investing online $10 at a time
loyal3 is a new service that allows small investors to put as little as $10 a month toward the purchase of a company's stock - sort of like a christmas club savings plan for little guys in the market. the fees are carried by the stock-issuing company, which figures the shareholders will buy more of the company's product.
